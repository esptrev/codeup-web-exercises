	<dt>How can I reserve a campsite? Do you have electric hookups?</dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		No reservations are accepted, as camping is first-come, first-served. Campers, including beach campers, must have a camping permit, which is available from the kiosks at the entrances of each campground. Campers may also pay their camping fees at the kiosks.There are no electric, water, or sewer hook-ups in the park. To learn more about camping in the park, please click here.

	<dt>How far can I drive down island? Can I get to South Padre from here? </dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		Depending on current beach conditions, two-wheel drive vehicles may safely drive down on the first five miles of South Beach. After that, four-wheel drive is necessary as there are frequent pockets of soft sand. Even with a four-wheel drive vehicle, you cannot reach South Padre Island from here. Mansfield Channel forms the southern boundary of the park at the 60 mile marker and there is no bridge or ferry over it to get to South Padre Island.

	<dt>Are you pet friendly?</dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		Pets on a leash are allowed everywhere in the park except for the Malaquite Visitor Center area. Pets are not allowed on the visitor center deck or the beach directly in front of the visitor center. Please be courteous to other visitors and clean up after your pet. Pets must be on a leash no longer than 6 feet and under your control at all times. Do not leave pets unattended in vehicles. For more information on pets in the park, click here.

	<dt>Where is the best birding?</dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		There are three main areas for good birding: the shore, the park road, and Bird Island Basin. Anywhere along the seashore is excellent for spotting a large variety of shorebirds including the endangered Snowy Plover and Piping Plover. Driving the park road will often enable one to see raptors and birds often associated with grasslands.Bird Island Basin is an excellent spot for watching marsh and shorebirds as well as raptors. For more information on birds and birding go to theNature and Science section of the park's main website.

	<dt>Is it always this windy? </dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		The average wind is approximately eleven miles per hour. Prevailing winds blow from the southeast in spring, summer and fall. During winter, the wind shifts direction more frequently with strong north winds blowing as cold fronts push south from the plains. The most
		powerful cold fronts can produce winds that may reach 50 to 65 miles per hour!
	</dd>

	<dt>Where is the best shelling? </dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		Shelling is less a matter of "where" than a matter of "when". Shelling is best after a storm has passed through. Large storm surges push large amounts of debris and shells far up onto the beach. Other than that, it would be best to go to an isolated area down island where few people venture, and thus there are fewer shell collectors to pick them up before you. However, be aware that after the five-mile marker a four-wheel drive vehicle is needed because of the frequent pockets of deep, soft sand.
	</dd>

	<dt>Why is there so much trash on the beach, and is anyone doing anything about it? </dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		The predominant southeast wind drives the currents in the Gulf of Mexico to our location in the Northwest corner. As a result, anything that falls or is tossed into the Gulf eventually ends up here. Most of these objects will, of course, be those that fall in closest to our shore and these tend to be objects from the fishing/shrimping industries and offshore natural gas platforms. Trying to keep more than 63 miles of beach clean is a monumental task and we do the best with the resources available. To a large degree we rely on public participation in placing wastes in the proper containers and in periodic beach clean-ups.
	</dd>

	<dt>Can I use my metal detector in the park?</dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		To preserve and protect cultural and natural resources, possession or use of metal detectors is prohibited in the park. Items such as unoccupied seashells, sea beans, and driftwood, washed in by the tide, may be collected as long as the items are not used for commercial purposes. All other collecting is strictly prohibited.
	</dd>

	<dt>Where can I go fishing and/or hunting?</dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		Fishing is permitted everywhere in the park except at Malaquite Beach directly in front of the visitor center. No hunting is permitted except for the taking of waterfowl by boat only in the Laguna Madre. Transporting any other lawfully taken wildlife through the park is prohibited.
	</dd>

	<dt>Where can I go to see sea turtles? </dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		The best place to go is the Texas State Aquarium in Corpus Christi. They have several on display, which have permanent injuries and would not survive in the wild. Although we have an ongoing project to restore the sea turtle populations in the Gulf of Mexico, we do not keep any on display at the Park. Our project consists of finding as many sea turtle nests as we can and taking the eggs to an incubation facility at the ranger station. There the eggs are cared for until they hatch. After hatching, we release them into the Gulf of Mexico. The releases are announced in the media so the public may attend. Click here for more information on hatchling releases.
	</dd>

	<dt>Can I feed the birds?</dt>
	<dd class="invisible">
		Feeding gulls or other birds in the park is NOT allowed and is strictly prohibited. Feeding birds can cause them to approach people too closely, beg for and steal food, and be less able to survive on their own. Feeding gulls also increases the danger for newly hatched sea turtles because gulls, hoping to be fed, are drawn to crowds of people and may swoop down and take a hatchling. Feeding gulls causes them to become more aggressive to humans and other wildlife.

		For the safety of our hatchlings and other wildlife, do not feed or approach the gulls.
		When youâ€™re at the beach, remember that gulls are wild animals and they live here- they do not need human food to survive.
