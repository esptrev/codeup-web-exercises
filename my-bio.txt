I'm married father of one. Spent the last 20 years decorating peoples walls with dead animals(taxidermist). Came to codeup for a change. Would like more time for the family and myself. 
We spend much of our free time down on the coast. She gets the beach and I get to fish. And I love tacos!! I was an Air-Force baby born in Ft. Worth. Raised in San Antonio, went to UTSA and never left.
